# Search-Robot-Simulator

Project from COMPX318 Mobile Computing and the Internet of Things where as a group of 2, we were to design a C based program to run on Riot OS, an operating system designed for use on low power internet of things devices. The program consists of a controller and robot side where we had to come up with a strategy and communication setup which would rescue the most people on the map while also balancing the amount of energy used by communication between the robots and controller. Explanation of the techniques we decided to use is as follows:

## Automation Techniques:

* Splitting a map up evenly between the number of robots and sends through jobs messages with the starting coordinates, end coordinates for a robot to navigate on its own without needing other instructions from the controller.
* If there is one robot is passed into the controller the entire area is assigned.
* If there is an even number of robots the width of the map is split in half and then the height of the map is split by half the number of robots to have 2 even groups working either side.
* If there is an odd number of robots, the number of robots - 1 are split through the even method, and the last robot is set aside as a backup for if others run out of energy or blow up.
* Robots continually communicate their position back to the controller for this data to be used in building a map which the user and controller can view.
* Half-finished jobs are automatically reassigned to idle robots who have finished searching their area, The point where a robot needs to go to resume a job is communicated to the robot rather than having the entire job be performed from the start. Robots will carry on searching the area while there are still tiles left to be searched
* In the case that a robot suddenly goes missing (Times out for 3 seconds), the program is designed to predict the locations of bombs through the controller keeping track of the pattern of movement that a robot would have made and using the last known coordinates, (It always goes left to begin with, once it reaches the bounds of its area it will go down, then it will start going right etc) These predictions are sent out to all robots before they are assigned a new job to allow for them to store the coordinates and make their way around the mines safely on their path. If a robot has previously sent out a "Low energy" message that it canâ€™t move, then the controller would not treat the disappearance as a bomb blowing up the robot.


## Communication Strategy:
* In order to keep messages short and easy to understand, CSV values with different keywords are used to identify the type of message being sent or received from the controller or robots. This and the way that communication updates are only sent from the robot during traveling makes the energy used for communicating quite a bit more efficient than constant backward and forward messages for commands and updates.
